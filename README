    ♦  # Add

SYNTAX

    2-9[x]...     # Assignment; the suit of first card designates
                  # target register
    A[x]          # Current value of register [x] (the Ace aces it)
    K[x]          # Jump to the last Q[x] label if A[x] != 0 (go see the Queen)
    Q[x]          # Label (the Queen is waiting)
    J[x]          # Print A[x] as character (Jack shows the goods)

EXAMPLES

    5♣            # ♣ = 5
    2♦ 3♥         # ♦ = 2 * 3 (♦ is 6)
    A♦ 2♦ 5♥      # ♦ = ♦ + 2 * 5 (♦ is 40)
    2♦ 3♥ A♣      # ♦ = 2 * 3 + ♣ (♦ is 11)
    Q♦ K♦         # Infinite loop since ♦ != 0

    # 15.times { |i| print i }
    3♥ 5♥         # ♥ = 3 * 5
    Q♥            # Label
    10♦           # Print current value of ♦
    A♦ 3♦ 2♠      # ♦ = ♦ + 3 - 2
